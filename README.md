##  Introduction

Managing medications can be challenging, especially for individuals who need to take multiple doses at different times of the day. Forgetting even a single dose can reduce the effectiveness of treatment or lead to health complications. Traditional pillboxes are passive and do not provide reminders, monitoring, or remote connectivity.

**Smart MediBox** was created to solve this problem. It is an intelligent pharmaceutical storage system that **not only reminds patients to take their medication** but also **monitors the storage environment** to ensure medicine quality is maintained. With IoT integration, it allows **remote monitoring, real-time alerts, and complete control from anywhere**.

This project combines **embedded systems, IoT communication, environmental sensing, and user interface design** into one compact solution.

##  Why Smart MediBox?

*  **Never miss a dose** – Intelligent alarm system keeps you on schedule.
*  **Store medicines safely** – Built-in temperature and humidity monitoring warns if conditions are unsafe.
*  **Environment-aware** – Automated shading adjusts light exposure, protecting sensitive medications.
*  **Stay connected** – IoT dashboard for remote access and real-time insights.
*  **No data loss** – Alarms and settings are saved in EEPROM, so even after a restart, the system remembers.

##  Features in Depth

###  Smart Time & Alarms

* Automatic **NTP time synchronization** (accurate global time, with time zones).
* Set multiple alarms for different medications.
* Alarms trigger **buzzer + OLED notifications**.
* User-friendly navigation with **push buttons** for alarm setup.

###  Environmental Monitoring

* **DHT22 sensor** continuously tracks temperature & humidity.
* Alerts if medicine storage goes out of safe range.
* Data logged and pushed via MQTT for remote visualization.

###  Light Management

* Dual **LDR sensors** measure ambient light intensity.
* Servo controlled shade automatically adjusts exposure.
* Manual override available via IoT dashboard.

##  Custom PCB Design  

To ensure compactness, reliability, and long-term usability, a **custom PCB** was designed using **EasyEDA**.  
Instead of relying on jumper wires and breadboards, the PCB integrates all core components of the MediBox in a single board, improving durability and reducing wiring complexity.  

###  Key Highlights:
* Designed in **EasyEDA** with proper schematics and PCB layout.  
* Compact footprint for enclosure-friendly design.  
* All sensor and actuator pins are clearly labeled for easy debugging.  
* Power distribution optimized for ESP32, sensors, and actuators.  
* Integrated connectors for OLED, DHT22, LDRs, Servo, and Buzzer.  
* Gerber files exported for fabrication, making it manufacturable.
